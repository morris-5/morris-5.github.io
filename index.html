                <h2>The Background</h2>

                <p>MK and other people like you around the world are gaining
                valuable experience, connections, and skills by
                coding, testing, and contributing for free software
                projects like Firefox, WordPress, Wikipedia's backend
                code, and SAGE.</p>

                <p>You do <em>not</em> need to know how to program to
                contribute to free software. You can contribute code,
                but also original art, testing, documentation, web
                design, or anything else. We want to teach you how to
                join them.</p>

                <h2>The events</h2>

                <p>On <strong>Wed 9/26 and Thu 9/26</strong>, in <strong>SEO 1000</strong>
                we want to bring you up to speed on open source
                projects and help you contribute to an amazing
                community.</p>

                <p>First, we'll teach you about open source
                licensing, helpful tools, and how free software
                projects are organized.</p>

                <p>Next, we'll help you make contributions
                to open source projects.</p>

                <p>And throughout the day we'll feed you, get to meet
                you, and converse with you about opportunities for
                students in open source.</p>

                <p>Space is pretty limited and we want to prepare to
                meet your needs.  Please sign up in advance

                <h2>More about open source</h2>
                <p>Free, open source software is software that is
                shared freely and available to build upon. It is a
                brilliant way to apply your skills to innovative projects
                and social causes. You can participate by writing or
                reviewing code, answering users' questions,
                translating the interface to another language, making
                video tutorials to help new users, and myriad other
                ways. Open source software is often produced by lots
                of people collaborating across time and space, and
                this event specially welcomes newcomers to that style
                of programming.</p>

                <p>Open source participation is one way to gain
                new skills and make connections that will last
                you through your career. Volunteer staff will include
                professionals and academics who use open source
                daily.</p>
